# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will improve EJS syntax highlighting to properly handle string interpolation, template literals, and complex expressions within EJS tags. Currently, complex expressions like nested ternary operators with string interpolation are not highlighted correctly, making code harder to read and debug.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working with EJS templates, I want proper syntax highlighting for string interpolation within EJS expressions, so that I can easily read and understand complex template code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using template literals with `${}` interpolation inside EJS tags THEN the system SHALL highlight the template literal syntax correctly
2. WHEN using nested string interpolation within ternary operators THEN the system SHALL maintain proper syntax highlighting for all parts
3. WHEN mixing single quotes, double quotes, and template literals in the same EJS expression THEN the system SHALL highlight each string type appropriately
4. WHEN string interpolation contains function calls or object property access THEN the system SHALL highlight the JavaScript syntax within the interpolation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper syntax highlighting for complex expressions within EJS tags, so that nested logic is visually clear and easier to debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using nested ternary operators within EJS expressions THEN the system SHALL highlight each condition, true value, and false value distinctly
2. WHEN using function calls with multiple parameters within EJS expressions THEN the system SHALL highlight function names, parameters, and separators correctly
3. WHEN using object method chaining within EJS expressions THEN the system SHALL highlight each method call and property access
4. WHEN using logical operators (&&, ||) within complex expressions THEN the system SHALL highlight the operators and operands correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent syntax highlighting across all EJS tag types, so that the visual experience is uniform regardless of the tag type used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using string interpolation in `<%= %>` output tags THEN the system SHALL apply the same highlighting rules as other tag types
2. WHEN using string interpolation in `<%- %>` unescaped output tags THEN the system SHALL apply the same highlighting rules as other tag types
3. WHEN using string interpolation in `<% %>` scriptlet tags THEN the system SHALL apply the same highlighting rules as other tag types
4. WHEN switching between different EJS tag types in the same file THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent highlighting behavior

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper highlighting of JavaScript keywords and operators within EJS expressions, so that the code structure is immediately visible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using JavaScript keywords (const, let, var, if, else, return) within EJS tags THEN the system SHALL highlight them as keywords
2. WHEN using comparison operators (===, !==, >, <, >=, <=) within EJS expressions THEN the system SHALL highlight them as operators
3. WHEN using arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) within EJS expressions THEN the system SHALL highlight them as operators
4. WHEN using assignment operators (=, +=, -=) within EJS expressions THEN the system SHALL highlight them as operators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error highlighting for malformed expressions within EJS tags, so that I can quickly identify and fix syntax errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are unmatched quotes within EJS expressions THEN the system SHALL highlight the error appropriately
2. WHEN there are unmatched parentheses or brackets within EJS expressions THEN the system SHALL highlight the error appropriately
3. WHEN there are incomplete template literal expressions THEN the system SHALL highlight the error appropriately
4. WHEN there are malformed string interpolation syntax THEN the system SHALL provide visual indication of the error
