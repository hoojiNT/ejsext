# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add "Go to Definition" functionality to the EJS syntax highlighting extension, allowing developers to navigate to variable definitions within EJS templates. When a user Ctrl+clicks (or Cmd+clicks on Mac) on a variable like `_viewsPath`, the editor will automatically jump to the line where that variable is defined.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working with EJS templates, I want to quickly navigate to where variables are defined, so that I can understand the code structure and debug more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user Ctrl+clicks on a variable within EJS template tags (`<% %>`, `<%- %>`, `<%= %>`) THEN the system SHALL navigate to the line where that variable is first defined
2. WHEN a user hovers over a variable THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip with the variable's definition location and value if available
3. WHEN a variable is defined multiple times in the same file THEN the system SHALL navigate to the first occurrence
4. WHEN a variable is not defined in the current file THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate message indicating the variable definition was not found

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Go to Definition feature to work with different EJS tag types, so that I can navigate variables regardless of how they're used in the template.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a variable is used in `<% %>` scriptlet tags THEN the system SHALL support Go to Definition functionality
2. WHEN a variable is used in `<%- %>` unescaped output tags THEN the system SHALL support Go to Definition functionality  
3. WHEN a variable is used in `<%= %>` escaped output tags THEN the system SHALL support Go to Definition functionality
4. WHEN a variable is used in template literals or string interpolation within EJS tags THEN the system SHALL support Go to Definition functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the feature to recognize different variable declaration patterns in EJS, so that it works with various coding styles and patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a variable is declared with `const` keyword THEN the system SHALL recognize it as a definition
2. WHEN a variable is declared with `let` keyword THEN the system SHALL recognize it as a definition
3. WHEN a variable is declared with `var` keyword THEN the system SHALL recognize it as a definition
4. WHEN a variable is assigned without declaration keywords (like function parameters) THEN the system SHALL recognize it as a definition
5. WHEN a variable is destructured from objects or arrays THEN the system SHALL recognize the destructured variables as definitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Go to Definition feature to provide visual feedback, so that I know when the feature is available and working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over a variable that has a definition THEN the system SHALL change the cursor to indicate it's clickable
2. WHEN hovering over a variable that has a definition THEN the system SHALL underline or highlight the variable
3. WHEN a variable definition is found THEN the system SHALL highlight the target line briefly after navigation
4. WHEN Go to Definition is triggered but no definition is found THEN the system SHALL show a user-friendly notification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the feature to work efficiently with large EJS files, so that navigation remains fast and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing files larger than 1000 lines THEN the system SHALL complete Go to Definition within 500ms
2. WHEN multiple variables have similar names THEN the system SHALL accurately match the exact variable name
3. WHEN the same variable name appears in comments or strings THEN the system SHALL ignore those occurrences and only consider actual variable usage
4. WHEN scanning for definitions THEN the system SHALL cache results to improve performance on subsequent requests
